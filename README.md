# unet-project-jan2026

The objective of this project was to implement and evaluate a U‑Net model for segmentation of the left ventricle in cardiac CT images. The model was constructed based on the fundamental building blocks of a U‑Net. After implementation, the network was trained on normalized data and subsequently evaluated using several metrics to assess its segmentation performance.

The implemented U‑Net achieved good segmentation results, despite only being trained on a relatively small dataset. Looking at pixel‑wise accuracy and loss values the model indicated strong performance, but looking at the Dice score, a more informative measure of segmentation quality, it was highlighted, that some challenges remain.
